To use css in html by 

-CSS selector 
A CSS selecttor is used to select on HTML element(s) for styling

body{
	color: red;
	background: pink;
}


-element selector
We can do it by using tag name itself

For example:- 
	h1{
	color: blue;
	}

-using class 
We have to put . Before class in css

For example:- . class name {}

-using ID 
We have to put # before a ID

For example:- #ID{}

*The CSS should end with a ; * 
*we can use a class multiple times in CSS but there can be only a single ID.
Which refers that ID is unique and can be used to assign unique things in our web page.


-Comments in CSS is text which will not parse and is thus ignored by our browser

comments are written by

/*comment*/

Important notes

-We can group selectors like this: 
h1, h2, h3, dic {
	color: blue;
	}

- we can use element class as selector like this:-
	P.red{
		color : red;
		}

* can be used as a universal selector to select all the elements
		* {
			margin : 0;
			padding : 0;
			}
			
An inline css style will override external and internal styles.
