HTML Hyper Text Mark Up Language

HTML is the language of the web.it is  to create websites"   We use HTML tags to define look & face of a website.

 With understanding of these tags and How to put them together, we can create beautiful websites easily!

Then why CSS & Java Script HTML is used for defining layout of a page - A barebone page structure.

CSS is used to add styling to that barebone page Created using HTML.

Java Script is used to program Logic for the page layout eg.

What happens when a user hovers on a text, when



to hide or show elements etc.

We start building a website by creating a file named index.html index html is a special filename which is presented when the website root address is typed.

A Basic HTML Page:- 

<! Doctype html > --> Specifies this is an HTML5 
<html>→reat of an HTML page doc.
<head> → Contains page metadata 
<title> Harry's Website </title> --> Contains title 
</head>
<body> → The main body of the page (rondered by the browser) 
<h1> This is a heading </h1>
<p> My paragraph </p> -->paragraph tag 
</body> → • closing body tag heading tag
</html>  



A tag is like a container for either content or other HTML tags.

Imp. Notes:
-Head & body tags are children of html tag. 
-HTML is the parent of head & body tags.
-Most of the HTML elements have opening & closing tag with content in between opening & closing tags.
-Some HTML tags have no content. These are called emoty elements 
eg. <br>
-we can either use .htm or .html extension.
-you can use "Inspect Element" or "view page source" option from chrome to look into a website's HTML code.

	HTML element = start tag + content + end tag
	
Comments in HTML 
-Comments in HTML are used to mark text which should not be parsed. They can help document the source code.

<!-- HTML Comment -->

case sensitivity
-HTML is a case insensitive language <H1> and <h1> tags are the same.

We can add elements inside the body tag to define page layout.
<body>   -opening tag
content 
</body>  -closing tag

To use css in html by 

-CSS selector 
A CSS selecttor is used to select on HTML element(s) for styling

body{
	color: red;
	background: pink;
}


-element selector
We can do it by using tag name itself

For example:- 
	h1{
	color: blue;
	}

-using class 
We have to put . Before class in css

For example:- . class name {}

-using ID 
We have to put # before a ID

For example:- #ID{}

*The CSS should end with a ; * 
*we can use a class multiple times in CSS but there can be only a single ID.
Which refers that ID is unique and can be used to assign unique things in our web page.


-Comments in CSS is text which will not parse and is thus ignored by our browser

comments are written by

/*comment*/

Important notes

-We can group selectors like this: 
h1, h2, h3, dic {
	color: blue;
	}

- we can use element class as selector like this:-
	P.red{
		color : red;
		}

* can be used as a universal selector to select all the elements
		* {
			margin : 0;
			padding : 0;
			}
			
An inline css style will override external and internal styles.

-Colors & backgrounds

CSS rules are simple key-value pairs with a selector, we can write  CSS rules to change color and set backgrounds.


-The color property 
The CSS color property can be used to set the text color inside an element 

p{
  color: red;
  }

similarly we can set color for different elements 

Types of color values following are the most commonly used color values in css 

1. RGB :- Specify color using Red, Green, Blue values. 
		eg. rgb(200,98,70)
2. HEX Code:L- Specify color using hex code. 
		eg. #ff7180
3. HSL:- Specify the color using hsl (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) values.
		eg. hsl(8, 90%, 63%)

The value of the color or background color is provided as any of these values.

NOTE:- We also have an RGBA and HSLA values for color but they are rarely used by beginners 
	HERE 'A' in "HSLA" stands for Alpha

*The background image property*
Used to set an image as the background. 

	body{
		background-image: url("filename.extension")
		}
The image is by default repeated in X & Y directions.


-The background-repeat property
can be any of:
-> repeat-x :----- repeat in horizontal direction.
-> repeat-y :----- repeat in vertical direction.
-> no repeat :---- image no repeat. 


-The background-size property 
can be following:
-> cover :---- fits & no empty space remains.
-> contain :---- fits & image is fully visible.
